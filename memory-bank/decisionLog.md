# Decision Log: mdCrawler

This file tracks significant architectural and design decisions made during the development of mdCrawler.

## [2025-05-06 10:53:00] - Memory Bank Initialization

**Decision**: Create a memory bank structure to maintain project context and track development decisions.

**Rationale**: 
- Provides centralized documentation for project context
- Enables better tracking of architectural decisions
- Improves knowledge transfer between development sessions
- Facilitates AI assistant understanding of project structure and goals

**Implications**:
- Need to keep memory bank files updated as project evolves
- Requires consistent documentation practices

## [2025-05-06 10:53:00] - Initial Architecture Analysis

**Decision**: Document the existing architecture patterns identified in the codebase.

**Rationale**:
- Establishes baseline understanding of the system
- Identifies key patterns for future development
- Provides context for future architectural decisions

**Implications**:
- Need to validate patterns with further code exploration
- May need to refine as understanding of the system deepens

## [2025-05-06 10:53:00] - Identified Crawler Configuration Strategy

**Decision**: The system uses a dual-configuration approach for crawling: one configuration for link discovery and another for content extraction.

**Rationale**:
- Link discovery needs less restrictive filtering to find all relevant pages
- Content extraction needs more aggressive filtering to produce clean Markdown
- Separation allows optimizing each phase independently

**Implications**:
- More complex configuration management
- Need to ensure both configurations remain in sync for optimal results
- Provides flexibility for different documentation site structures

## [2025-05-06 10:53:00] - Timeout and Rate Limiting Implementation

**Decision**: Implement timeout limits and request delays in the crawler.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents infinite crawling of large documentation sites
- Shows respect for target servers by limiting request frequency
- Improves reliability by handling potential hanging requests

**Implications**:
- May not process all pages on very large documentation sites
- Slightly increased processing time due to delays
- More predictable and reliable operation

## [2025-05-06 11:07:00] - Project Refactoring for Modularity and Distribution

**Decision**: Refactor the project to improve modularity, with a thin entry point (main.py) that delegates to core implementation in src/main.py.

**Rationale**:
- Enables packaging the project as a distributable binary (Python to exe)
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Facilitates future extensions and enhancements
- Supports multiple deployment options (package, binary, GitHub Actions, Docker)

**Implications**:
- Need to restructure existing code
- Must maintain backward compatibility for existing users
- Requires clear separation between entry point and implementation
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect new structure

## [2025-05-06 11:07:00] - Enhanced Configuration System

**Decision**: Enhance the configuration system with environment variable support, default configurations, and URL pattern filtering.

**Rationale**:
- Provides more flexibility for different deployment scenarios
- Enables configuration through environment variables for CI/CD pipelines
- Allows for more precise control over which URLs are processed
- Supports custom content cleaning for specific documentation sites

**Implications**:
- More complex configuration handling logic
- Need to document new configuration options
- Backward compatibility considerations for existing configurations
- Testing required for different configuration scenarios

## [2025-05-06 11:07:00] - Plugin Architecture for Content Cleaners

**Decision**: Implement a plugin architecture for content cleaners that can be dynamically loaded.

**Rationale**:
- Allows for site-specific content cleaning without modifying core code
- Enables community contributions for specific documentation sites
- Improves extensibility of the system
- Keeps core code clean and focused

**Implications**:
- Need to implement dynamic module loading
- Requires documentation for plugin development
- Error handling for plugin failures
- Testing framework for plugins

## [2025-05-06 11:07:00] - GitHub Actions Integration

**Decision**: Support running the tool as part of GitHub Actions workflows with local testing via "act".

**Rationale**:
- Enables automated documentation updates
- Provides CI/CD integration for documentation maintenance
- Allows for scheduled updates of documentation
- Local testing improves development workflow

**Implications**:
- Need to create GitHub Actions workflow definitions
- Documentation for GitHub Actions setup
- Testing with "act" for local workflow validation
- Consideration of rate limits and timeouts in CI environment

## [2025-05-06 12:00:00] - Module Renaming and Minimal Entry Point

**Decision**: Rename src/main.py to src/md_crawler.py and further simplify the main.py entry point.

**Rationale**:
- More descriptive module name that reflects its purpose
- Minimal entry point better supports both library and executable use cases
- Clearer separation between interface and implementation
- Improves code organization and maintainability

**Implications**:
- Easier to package as both a library and an executable
- Clearer project structure for new contributors
- Reduced complexity in the entry point
- Better alignment with Python packaging best practices

## [2025-05-06 11:52:00] - Successful Implementation of Thin Entry Point

**Decision**: Implement the thin entry point pattern by refactoring main.py to delegate to src/main.py.

**Rationale**:
- Validates the modular architecture design
- Confirms backward compatibility is maintained
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the refactoring approach
- Provides a foundation for further enhancements

**Implications**:
- Simplified maintenance of the entry point
- Clearer separation of concerns in the codebase
- Easier to extend functionality in src/main.py without affecting the CLI interface
- Better support for future packaging as a distributable binary
